fix: try counter improvements and new drop check feature

This commit includes three major fixes and one new feature:

1. Fix: Alunira/Crackling Shard counter after collection
   - Repeatable items with yields now stop counting when all yields are collected
   - Prevents unnecessary Crackling Shard tracking after Alunira mount is obtained
   - Applies to all accumulation items (Crackling Shard, Miscellaneous Mechanica)
   - Updated trackable filtering in 6 locations across TryCounterService.lua

2. Fix: HK-8 Aerial Oppression Unit NPC variant (158090)
   - Added missing NPC ID 158090 to HK-8 encounter mapping
   - Verified drop source: https://www.wowhead.com/npc=155157/hk-8-aerial-oppression-unit
   - Updated CollectibleSourceDB with NPC drops, encounter mapping, and name mapping
   - Fixes incorrect counter attribution from Trixie & Naeno

3. Feature: Drop check command (/wn check)
   - New debug command to inspect NPC/GameObject drops
   - Shows all collectibles, collection status, try counts, and drop flags
   - Supports both target and mouseover units
   - Includes boss encounter mapping and yields information
   - Formatted output with type icons and colored status

4. Fix: Secret value protection for drop check in instances
   - Use SafeGetUnitGUID instead of direct UnitGUID calls
   - Prevents taint errors in instances (Midnight 12.0+)
   - Graceful degradation when GUIDs are restricted

Files changed:
- Modules/TryCounterService.lua: Yields checking, CheckTargetDrops function, secret value fix
- Modules/CollectibleSourceDB.lua: Added HK-8 NPC 158090 variant
- Modules/CommandService.lua: Added /wn check command routing
- Docs/: Technical documentation for all changes
