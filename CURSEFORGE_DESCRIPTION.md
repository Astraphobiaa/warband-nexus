# ⚔️ Warband Nexus

### Your Warband, One Window.

Warband Nexus brings all your characters together in a single, beautiful interface. Track items, reputations, currencies, Great Vault progress, and collection goals — all without switching characters.

Just type **`/wn`** to open it.

## 🔍 Why Warband Nexus?

Playing multiple characters means constantly logging in and out just to check things like:

- *"Where did I put that reagent?"*
- *"Which character has the highest rep?"*
- *"Did I fill my vault this week?"*

Warband Nexus scans your characters automatically and gives you the full picture — always up to date, always one click away.

## ✨ Features

### 👥 Characters
See all your characters at a glance — gold, item level, professions, keystones, and last played. Total gold across all characters and realms is always visible.

### 🎒 Warband Bank & Inventory
Browse your Warband Bank and personal banks from anywhere. Search for any item across all characters instantly. Never wonder *"which alt has my flask"* again.

### 🏛️ Reputations
View all faction progress across your warband. Account-wide and character-specific reputations are neatly separated. Renown levels, paragon cycles, friendship ranks — all tracked automatically.

### 💰 Currencies
Track every currency across all characters. Warband-transferable and character-specific currencies are organized separately. Hover to see per-character breakdowns.

### 🏆 Great Vault & PvE
Check Great Vault progress for every character without logging into each one. Raid lockouts, Mythic+ scores, and delve progress — all at a glance.

### 📋 Plans & Collection Tracker
Set goals for mounts, pets, toys, achievements, and transmog you want to collect. The floating **Plans Tracker** window keeps your goals visible while you play. A built-in **try counter** tracks how many attempts it took to get that rare drop!

### 🔔 Loot Notifications
Get a satisfying on-screen alert when you collect a new mount, pet, toy, or achievement — complete with attempt count if you've been farming.

### 📊 Statistics
See your account-wide collection progress — mounts, battle pets, toys, titles, achievement points, and total storage usage.
